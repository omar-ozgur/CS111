*** README ***

Language Used: Python
To run executable: make run
					OR
					chmod u+x lab3b.py
					python lab3b.py

File Information:

	README: This file gives information about the files that are included in the project, as 
	well as information regarding features and methods of testing.

	Makefile: This is the makefile that was created to automate useful tasks. The default target
	simply changes user privileges so that the tester can run the script. The run command will
	run the executable and generate the error report, provided the necessary csv files are in the same
	project directory. The clean target will remove the executable generated by the run target.
	The dist target generates a tarball of 3 files - lab3b.py (source code), Makefile and README.

	lab3b.py: A python script that will open and read through each of the csv files respectively
	and parse through them to find all the errors asked for in the specification. This source code
	is broken up based on functions, with the first function doing a lot of the heavy lifting for 
	initialization of data structures used through the other functions. We in the process
	generate lists of free inodes, blocks, bitmap block numbers, allocated inodes, and generate
	dictionaries (hash maps) of block numbers to referenced inodes, inodes to referenced dictionaries
	and more.
