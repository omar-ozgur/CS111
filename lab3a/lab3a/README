File Information:

	README: This file gives information about the files that are included in the project, as 
	well as information regarding features and methods of testing.

	Makefile: This is the makefile that was created to automate useful tasks. The "make" 
	command causes the default target to be executed, which builds the executable program 
	"lab3a". "make clean" can be used to remove files created by the build process. 
	"make dist" can be used to create a distributable tarball containing the files "README", 
	"Makefile", and "lab3a.c".

	lab3a.c: This "C" file can be compiled with the "make" command to create an executable
	program called "lab3a" that will analyze certain components of an ext2 file system. It
	does so by using 6 distinct functions to parse the super block, group descriptors, free
	bitmap entries, inodes, directory entries, and indirect blocks of the disk image that
	is provided as the only argument to the program. The specific properties that are
	extracted are saved in the 6 files "super.csv", "group.csv", "bitmap.csv", "inode.csv",
	"directory.csv", and "indirect.csv" respectively.
